    JPaxos 1.0      2011-04-XX
-------------------------------

  Description
  -----------
  
JPaxos is an implementation of state machine replication based on the Paxos 
algorithm, that is designed for the crash-recovery model with benign faults. 
It consists of a programming library and a runtime written in Java, that can 
be easily used by applications to replicate any deterministic service.

The main goal of this project is to provide an experimental platform for 
research into software-based replication, with focus on the challenges of 
using the theoretical results in practical, real-world system.
